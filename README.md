# Yet Another UploadBot

Telegram bot able to upload large file.

## Installation

YAUploadBot requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.4.0.

### Dependencies installation

To be able to run tele_uploader, you **must** install all the dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt); to do that, type:

```sh
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This process can take a while...

## Configuration

After all dependencies are satisfied, you can start to configure the environment variables.

For convenience, I've listed them inside the [config.py](/config.py) file so that the only thing you have to do is open it and fill with your keys.

### Keys meaning

We have just eight keys:

- TG_BOT_TOKEN  : the unique token generated by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- APP_ID        : Get your own token from my.telegram.org 
- API_HASH      : Get your own token from my.telegram.org
- TL_SESSION    : Most probably, you won't need to change this. This location is where your login session is stored
- DOWNLOAD_LOCATION : The directory where the downloaded files should be stored
- BOTAN_IO_TOKEN : If you want to get analytics usiong http://botan.io (but, unFortunately it is down now!)
- MAX_FILE_SIZE  : The maximum file size that the bot should be able to download
- CHUNK_SIZE     : The chunks in which to keep the downloaded parts in RAM. Keep this low, if you cannot spare much memory

## Run!

Now we're ready to execute the bot!

Let's import the environment variable, with:

```sh
$ cp config.sample.py config.py
```

and then...run!

```sh
$ python bot.py
```
