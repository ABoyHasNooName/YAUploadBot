# Yet Another UploadBot

Telegram bot able to upload large file, also on Dropbox!

## Installation

YAUploadBot requires [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php) >= 5.6.0 and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to run.

### Dependencies installation

To be able to run tele_uploader, you **must** install all the dependencies listed in [composer.json](/composer.json); to do that, type:

```sh
$ composer install
```

This process can take a while...

## Configuration

After all dependencies are satisfied, you can start to configure the environment variables.

For convenience, I've listed them inside the [env.sh](/env.sh) file so that the only thing you have to do is open it and fill with your keys.

### Keys meaning

We have just four keys:

- BOT_TOKEN: the unique token generated by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Run!

Now we're ready to execute the bot!

Let's import the environment variable, with:

```sh
$ source env.sh
```

and then...run!

```sh
$ php bot.php
```
